Examples

Lots of example sketches to get a taste of coding creatively with OCaml.

 0. Red square -- the quintessential "hello world" p5 sketch
 1. Changing background colour -- smoothly changing the background colour with `Math.sin`
 2. With sketch -- this shows how to use p5 in instance-mode for OCaml. Typically you only need to do this when you want more than one canvas per page, or it is needed if you are running sketches in the toplevel.
