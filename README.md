OCaml + p5.js 
-------------

This library provides (some) Js_of_ocaml bindings to the incredible [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. There are still many functions to be bound to and only the globally-scoped version of p5 is currently supported, but it's at least in a position where people can use it to play with programming and OCaml.
